# /Data
#
# The system will be installed into the well known Android partition /data
#
# How to determine the device name :
#     Search the /data partition name (under Android look into the file /fstab.<hardware>)
#
#     eg : /dev/block/platform/msm_sdcc.1/by-num/p14   /data   [...]
#     
#     Than run under Android:
#       ls -l /dev/block/platform/msm_sdcc.1/by-num/p14
#       (output will look like: [...] p14 -> /dev/block/mmcblk0p14)
#
#     Now run 'cat /proc/partition' and you should see mmcblk0p14 (without /dev/block)
#     So mmcblk0p14 is the name to set into DATA_DEVICE
#     
# IMPORTANT: mmcblk0p14 is just an example. Replace with your value
#   
DATA_DEVICE="mmcblk0p14"
